# AKS-WS-Container-View-Live-Data
There is a preview function in AKS that allow you to view the sysout generated by your REST webservice deployed in a container. 

Assuming that you have developed a model and deployed it into AKS. In the score.py file you have a few print() statements to show the input/output. You want to check the data flow in real time for debugging purpose.

With this (preview) function of AKS now you can do so as long as you enabled App Insight. You can view the sysout/err in live from Monitoring->Insights->Container-> select your specific container -> View Live Data (Preview). Then you can call the web service from Postman or a python app. In the live data stream you can see the request with headers and response as well as some info about your container.

Thanks,
Jack
